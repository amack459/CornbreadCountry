         For our Charleston folks (and some of the surrounding areas) we deliver it directly to you for a small delivery charge. (If you ain't nearby, we can arrange for a closer pick-up!) And, you'd be surprised by how affordable our meals are! "Country" is never supposed to cost too much! See, having your meals prepared for you weekly is easy as pie...and it won't even break your piggy bank! In fact, our clients tell us they save on the grocery bill, and no longer waste food they never really intended to cook anyway.</p>

            Now, we can't guarantee, however, that it won't keep you fat and happy - it is Southern comfort food! (But, we are conscious of that, too. We use high quality ingredients and no pork fat - we'll cook for you like we cook for our own family. That's a promise.)

            Ok, now you've got all the information, it's all up to you.
