      <h1>What We're Cooking Up:</h1>
      
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Cornbread Country Family Meals - Our family meals serve (5) people with generous portions! Simply choose 2-3 meals for the week from our menu (salad included) and we'll prepare them and deliver them to you on Monday evening. We'll even throw in a complimentary pan of our Signature Cornbread ;)</li> 

        <li>Cornbread Country LunchStacks™ - Not interested in burgers and fries or vending machine food for lunch? No worries! We've got your Southern staples made fresh, portioned, packaged and ready for you! Our LunchStacks™ are super popular, and super convenient. Once we deliver on Monday evening, just stack them in the fridge and "grab and go" all week long! The only problem you'll have is your co-workers pestering you while you eat...use your manners and share!</li>  
        <li>Cornbread Country Sunday Dinners - We'll even make Sunday dinner for you and you can invite the rest of your family over to break bread with you after church! Collards, Pot Roast, Steamed Rice, Macaroni & Cheese, choose what you like...then simply heat and serve! And, did we mention the cornbread? Trust us on that...</li>  
      </ul>

      <p>"At Work" Catered Lunches & Private Events - And, if you want to get "country" at work, we can help you there, too! We prepare staff lunches for the office team meetings. We even do small, private events, like backyard weddings and baby showers for those with lil' ones on the way ;) If you want Southern country, we can do it for ya, anytime and anywhere!

      For our Charleston folks (and some of the surrounding areas) we deliver it directly to you for a small delivery charge. (If you ain't nearby, we can arrange for a closer pick-up!) And, you'd be surprised by how affordable our meals are! "Country" is never supposed to cost too much! See, having your meals prepared for you weekly is easy as pie...and it won't even break your piggy bank! In fact, our clients tell us they save on the grocery bill, and no longer waste food they never really intended to cook anyway.

        Now, we can't guarantee, however, that it won't keep you fat and happy - it is Southern comfort food! (But, we are conscious of that, too. We use high quality ingredients and no pork fat - we'll cook for you like we cook for our own family. That's a promise.)

        Ok, now you've got all the information, it's all up to you. If you are ready to get started, simply download our menu and pricing and then email us your order, or any questions you may have. And, if you've been referred to us by any of our weekly clients, let us know in your email. We have sweet, special ways to thank them ;)

        Thank you for allowing our meals a place at your table. It truly is an honor to cook for you and your family!

        Blessings to ya!</p>

Watson, thank you, we will be ordering again!!" ~Tarsha, North Charleston, SC</p>
