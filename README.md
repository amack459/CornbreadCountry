# CornbreadCountry

A revamp of the exsisting site, which was a long scrolling site made with solely adobe design transferred to an html file. The restrictions were that I had to keep all of the text and the the color scheme. I've made something that makes the information more readable and provides something a bit more visually pleasing and easier for the consumer to maneuver through the information. Call to actions are placed on every page as well as a navbar to quickly and easily find the information that is most important to the consumer.
